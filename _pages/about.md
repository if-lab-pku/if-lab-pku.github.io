WE ARE HIRING
===

We are looking for self-motivated students to work on **Machine Learning System**, including efficient AI computing, domain specific architecture, mobile systems, and distributed machine learning.

We now have *openings* for **PhD (to start in Fall 2027)** and **undergraduate/graduate interns**.  
If you are interested in our research, please contact Prof. Chen via mail as soon as possible.

We prefer students with hands-on system building skills (e.g. C++/CUDA/Python programming, hardware design, etc.) or mathematics background.
