WE ARE HIRING
===

We are looking for self-motivated graduate students and undergraduate interns to work on **Machine Learning and System** research, including efficient AI computing, hardware architechture, mobile systems, and distributed machine learning.

We prefer students with hands-on system building skills (e.g. C++/CUDA/Python programming, hardware design, etc.) or mathematics background.
